# TechBlog Application

## Overview

TechBlog is a full-stack blog application built with React and Express.js. The application follows a modern, component-based architecture that allows users to view, create, and manage blog posts. It features a responsive design using shadcn/ui components, a REST API backend, and is designed to support both public content consumption and administrative content management.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React and uses a file-based routing system through Wouter. The UI is constructed using shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, providing accessible and customizable interface elements. The styling is handled through Tailwind CSS with a comprehensive design system that includes custom CSS variables for theming.

**State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) is used for server state management, providing caching, synchronization, and background updates. Local component state is managed with React's built-in useState and useContext hooks.

**Component Structure**: The application follows a modular component architecture with clear separation between layout components (Navbar, Footer), page components (Home, Blog, Admin), and reusable UI components. Components are organized in a hierarchical structure with shared components in the `/components` directory.

### Backend Architecture
The server is built using Express.js with TypeScript, following a RESTful API design pattern. The application uses a storage abstraction layer (`IStorage` interface) that currently implements an in-memory storage solution (`MemStorage`) but is designed to easily switch to database-backed storage.

**API Design**: REST endpoints follow conventional patterns with proper HTTP methods and status codes. The API includes comprehensive error handling and validation using Zod schemas. Request/response logging middleware provides visibility into API usage.

**Development Setup**: The application uses Vite for development with hot module replacement and includes middleware for serving the React application in production builds.

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses an abstract storage interface that supports both users and blog management. Currently implemented with in-memory storage but includes database schema definitions using Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL. The schema includes proper relationships, constraints, and type safety.

**Schema Design**: Blog posts include fields for title, content, excerpt, category, publication status, and timestamps. Users have basic authentication fields. The schema uses UUID primary keys and includes proper indexing considerations.

### Authentication and Authorization
The application includes user authentication infrastructure with session-based authentication using connect-pg-simple for session storage. While not fully implemented in the current codebase, the foundation is in place for user registration, login, and role-based access control.
